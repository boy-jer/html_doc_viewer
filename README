This is an experimental Rails application to build a HTML based document viewer that takes a PDF document and renders it in HTML form. It uses a backend Sinatra service to handle the actual conversion.

The conversion has the following dependencies:
xpdf
ghostscript
freetype
poppler-utils
pdftohtml

The viewer can be played around with at http://viewer-reboot.herokuapp.com/
